The automation for student stress prediction in
institutes and educational organizations has been very
minimal.

Observing each student and his or her profile is
a huge task. This responsibility lies under human
interaction and that is why our work paves way for the
automatic stress prediction of each student
under various parameters and proposes the solution to
each student rightly.

This is done with the help of
Machine learning and data science techniques.

Students are classified as to whether they are stress
free or stress full and if they are stressful, their range of
stress is highlighted. Based on this percentage, the
authorities give each individual solutions and advice.
